                  This website highlights me as a person through my work experiences and hobbies. I am currently working at a law firm full time and have been working as a real estate agent part time.
                  I am looking to transition from my current position at a law firm to becoming a software developer for a cloud based tech company. 
                  I fell into coding by creating scripts for my current position at the law firm and then implenting those scripts for my work as a part time Real Estate Agent.  
                  I enjoy completing projects and pushing through the hard parts into getting the objective done. I find that it is most satisfying the harder the challenge may be.

                      Recreational work includes many things involving real estate, and techonology. Outside of working, some of my main recrecational activities include going hiking, fishing, clamming, and going to the gym. When I am not out into the world I like to spend time with my 2 dogs, Ezekeial and Ezreal where we watch tv shows and movies.
